! the improved Mellor-Yamada level 3 model
     mymodel3  = 3

! 02 Switch to use code implemented for 3D TKE
logical :: l_3dtke = .false.

!
! 03 Maximum level to predict the prognostic variables in the TKE scheme.
integer :: tke_levels = imdi

! 04 If true and the parameter "tke_levels" is less than bl_levels, diffusion
! coefficients between tke_levels + 1 and bl_levels are evaluated with the
! stability function (i.e. local scheme)
logical :: l_local_above_tkelvs = .false.

! assuming balance between production and dissipation. If missing values
! are set to the prognostic variables through the reconfiguration, the
! initialization will be automatically conducted.

! 06 In the case that l_my_initialize == .true. or missing values are set to
! the prognostic variables through the reconfiguration, they are initialized
! to zeros if it is true.

! 09 If true, buoyancy parameters appearing in TKE production by buoyancy are
! evaluated with predicted variants assuming that fluctuation of heat and

! function. If false, buoyancy parameters calculated in the large scale
! clouds scheme (e.g. Smith, PC2), are employed to evaluate the buoyancy flux.
